## Overview

The **kappaTNG** suite is composed of mock weak lensing maps created
from [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/) simulations
with ray-tracing technique.

## Downloading the data

We released the full kappaTNG datasets hosted by the file server at Kavli IPMU.
The site is [here](https://idark.ipmu.jp/~jia.liu/data/kappaTNG).
The maps generated from full-physics (TNG300) and dark-matter only (TNG300-Dark) runs are located at `fullphys` and `dmonly`.
Each directory has `maps` and the map files are found as `LP[001-100]/LP[001-100]_run[001-100]_maps.hdf5`.
We provide a sample script to download the map files [here](download_maps.sh).

The file format is updated to HDF5 instead of binary format.
The old codes are kept in the directory [`binary`](binary).
We recommend you use the new format.

## Codes

We provide a jupyter notebook to load lensing maps ([`load_map.ipynb`](load_map.ipynb)) and
to use the fitting formula of the angular power spectrum ratio ([`fitting_formula.ipynb`](fitting_formula.ipynb)).


## Format of maps

The convergence maps are defined in regular grids.

* number of grids: $1024 \times 1024$
* angular size on a side: 5 deg
* resolution: 0.29 arcmin/pixel

There are 40 source redshifts and exact values are found in [`zs.dat`](zs.dat).
