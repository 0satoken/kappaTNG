## Overview

The **kappaTNG** suite is composed of mock weak lensing maps created
from [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/) simulations
with ray-tracing technique.
Additional information is available at [Columbia Lensing](http://columbialensing.org/).


## Codes
We provide sample codes for loading the binary file in C (`load_map.c`)
and Python (`load_map.ipynb`) and a fitting formula to the angular power spectrum (`fitting_formula.ipynb`).


## Data sets
In this repository, only a single map (`sample_kappa.dat`) is provided.
The sample data set (100 realizations with 3 redshifts: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
for both **kappaTNG** and **kappaTNG-Dark**)
is available at [Columbia Lensing](http://columbialensing.org/).
If you need the full data set (10,000 realizations with 40 redshifts) or
other quantities (deflection angles, shear, rotation),
please send your request to Ken Osato (ken.osato@yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp).


## Data format
The convergence maps are defined in regular grids.
The specifications of the maps are as follows:

* number of grids: 1024x1024
* angular size on a side: 5 deg
* resolution: 0.29 arcmin/pixel
* The source redshift of the sample map is z = 1.023.
